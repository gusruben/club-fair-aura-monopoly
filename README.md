# Fortune Phone

> Better name pending...

Inspired by [Club Fair Attention Monopoly](https://github.com/tmb/club-fair-attention-monopoly), I wanted to make a project to advertise [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) at club fairs, with a little more pizzazz. 

It's a website meant to be run on a TV at club fairs, and when someone texts the number on-screen, their fortune will appear on screen (with the last 4 digits of their phone number to identify them). Fortunes are generated by Claude, and might be a little ominous >:)

Coming soon-- The project's not done yet!
