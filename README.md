# ðŸ”® Fortune Phone

> Better name pending...

Inspired by [Club Fair Attention Monopoly](https://github.com/tmb/club-fair-attention-monopoly), I wanted to make a project to advertise [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) at club fairs, with a little more pizzazz.

It's a website meant to be run on a TV at club fairs, and when someone texts the number at the top with their name, their fortune will appear on-screen (don't worry, it's censored)! Fortunes are generated by AI, and might be a little ominous >:)

If you end up using this at your club fair, send me a photo!

## Setup

1. Clone the repo & install the dependencies with [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```
git clone https://github.com/gusruben/fortune-phone.git

bun install
```

2. Make a [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com/) account, and add $2-$5 worth of credits.
3. ["Buy" a number](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/buy-numbers) in the Telnyx portal.
4. [Create a "messaging profile"](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/programmable-messaging/profiles) for the number, and for the "Send a webhook to this URL" field, paste in `https://example.com/api/telnyx` or the equivalent for wherever you are running this.

   > If you are not running this on a public server, trying using a tool like [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel your server to the internet. For example, `bore local 5173 --to bore.pub --port 5678` would result in a URL of `http://bore.pub:5678/api/telnyx`.

5. Lastly, [select the number you bought](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/my-numbers) and set the profile to the one you just created.
6. Obtain an API key for [Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/) OR [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and load it with a few credits.
7. Add the API key and phone number to .env:

```sh
VITE_PHONE_NUMBER=+1 (234) 555-6789 # This can be in any format you want, it's only used for display
# Use either one of these, you only need one! I've been getting better results with Claude.
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-XXXXXXXXXXXXX...
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-XXXXXXXXXXXXX...
```

9. Done! The website should be fully functional!

## Technologies

This project is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with [Bun](https://bun.sh), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling on the frontend. It uses [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) for SMS and [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) (Claude) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com) (ChatGPT) for fortune generation.

This project was inspired by <https://github.com/tmb/club-fair-attention-monopoly>.
